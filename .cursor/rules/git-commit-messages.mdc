# Git Commit Session Summaries

## Provide comprehensive git commit summaries for entire coding sessions.

At the end of each coding session with multiple changes, provide a detailed but concise summary of ALL changes made since the last git push to remote. This summary will be copy-pasted directly into the git commit message area.

### Summary Requirements:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage** - Include all files changed, features added, bugs fixed
2. **Logical Grouping** - Group related changes together 
3. **Clear Structure** - Use bullet points or numbered lists for readability
4. **Specific Details** - Mention specific components, functions, or features affected
5. **Copy-Paste Ready** - Format for direct use in commit message box

### Summary Structure:

```
[Main Action]: [Primary focus of the session]

â€¢ [Category 1]: [Specific changes in this area]
  - [Detail 1]
  - [Detail 2]
â€¢ [Category 2]: [Specific changes in this area]
  - [Detail 1] 
  - [Detail 2]
â€¢ [Category 3]: [Additional changes]

[Optional: Impact or rationale for major changes]
```

### Good Example:
```
Update: Enhanced modal system and improved cursor rules documentation

â€¢ Modal Components:
  - Fixed ScrollView configuration for better mobile compatibility
  - Added proper keyboard handling and nested scroll support
  - Updated ActivityListModal and SaveLoadModal sizing patterns

â€¢ Cursor Rules:
  - Created modal-popup-best-practices.mdc with mobile scrolling patterns
  - Updated directory-structure.mdc with 8 new components and current file sizes
  - Enhanced tech-stack.mdc with API deployment workflow and AI integration docs

â€¢ API Documentation:
  - Added critical Vercel deployment requirements (vercel --prod)
  - Documented OpenRouter AI service integration patterns
  - Included error handling and fallback strategies

Ensures all modals work smoothly on Expo Go mobile and documents current project state accurately.
```

### Categories to Consider:
- **Components**: New components, component updates, UI improvements
- **API/Backend**: API endpoints, serverless functions, external integrations
- **Documentation**: Rule updates, README changes, code comments
- **Bug Fixes**: Specific issues resolved, error handling improvements
- **Features**: New functionality, feature enhancements
- **Configuration**: Build scripts, config file updates, dependency changes
- **Performance**: Optimizations, memory improvements, bundle size reductions
- **Accessibility**: A11y improvements, WCAG compliance updates

### Template Format:

At the end of major coding sessions, provide:

```
## ðŸ“‹ Git Commit Summary:
```
[Your comprehensive session summary here]
```
```

### Implementation:
- Provide summaries for sessions with multiple file changes
- Focus on the user's main goals and what was accomplished
- Be specific enough to understand what changed without being verbose
- Ready for direct copy-paste into git commit message field
- Include impact/rationale for major architectural changes
